FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Emergency Priority using Verilog
# FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Priority System

This project implements an FPGA-based traffic light controller using Verilog HDL. 
The system is designed using a Finite State Machine (FSM) and includes an emergency 
vehicle priority override mechanism.

## Features
- Verilog HDL based design
- FSM based traffic light controller
- Emergency vehicle priority system
- Clock divider for real-time operation
- Simulation using ModelSim / Vivado
- Suitable for Xilinx Spartan FPGA boards

## Tools Used
- Xilinx Vivado
- ModelSim
- Verilog HDL
